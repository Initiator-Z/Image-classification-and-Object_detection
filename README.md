# Project
This project contains seperate tasks of image classification and object detection

## Description
###Image Classification
Use DenseNet201 as the bases of transfer learning to classify weathers in the given dataset. 

###Object Detection
Uses Faster-RCNN and SDD as the convolutional base to detect redblood cells in the given dataset.

### Dependencies
#### Image Classification
* tensorflow 2.3.0
* keras 2.4.0
* matplotlib 3.4.2
* 1.20.1

#### Object Detection
* tensorflow 1.15.2
* numpy 1.17.4

### Installing
* clone the repository or download directly

### Executing program
* Run the files in jupyter notebook.
* Each notebook corresponds to the specific task to be performed.
